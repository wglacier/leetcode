# 0011. Container With Most Water, medium, , freq: 72%, acceptance: 45.8%
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

Note: y-axis is not included
## C++

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1;
        int r = 0; 
        while(i < j) {
            int a = height[i];
            int b = height[j];
            r = max(r, (j-i)*min(a, b));
            // search from the lower end, 
            // because if searching from the higher end, even find a higher one, it still use the lower end to calc area
            if (height[i] <= height[j]) {
                while(i < j && height[i] <= a) i++;
            } else {
                while(i < j && height[j] <= b) j--;
            }
        }
        return r;
    }
};
