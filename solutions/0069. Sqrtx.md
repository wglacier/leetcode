### Sqrt(x), easy

<pre>
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the
integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x < 1) return x;
        
        long a = 1, b = x;
        while (a <= b) {
            long m = a + (b-a)/2;
            long r = m*m;
            if (r == x) return m;
            if (r > x)
                b = m-1;
            else
                a = m+1;
        }
        return b;
    }
};

            if (r == x) return a;
            if (r > x) {
                a /= 2;
                break;
            }
            a *= 2;
        }
        double low = a, high = x/2;
        while (high - low > 0.00001) {
            double m = (low+high)/2;
            double r = m*m;
            if (r == x) return m;
            if (r > x) {
                high = m;
            } else {
                low = m;
            }
        }
        return (low+high)/2;
    }
