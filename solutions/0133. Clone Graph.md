# 0133. Clone Graph, medium, , freq: 50%, acceptance: 27.5%

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

 

Example:



Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 

Note:

The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

            return it->second;
        }
        auto t = new Node(-1, {});
        mp[p] = t;
        return t;

        queue<Node*> qq;
        qq.push(node);
        Node* res = nullptr;
        while (!qq.empty()) {
            auto p = qq.front(); qq.pop();
            auto q = getNode(mp, p);
            if (!res) res = q;
            if (!q->neighbors.empty())
                continue;
            q->val = p->val;
            for (const auto& n : p->neighbors) {
                auto qc = getNode(mp, n);
                q->neighbors.push_back(qc);
                if (qc->neighbors.empty()) {
                    qq.push(n);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
