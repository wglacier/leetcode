# 0137. Single Number II, medium, , freq: 30%, acceptance: 46.6%

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

"Given an array of integers, every element appears k (k > 1) times except for one, which appears p times (p >= 1, p % k != 0). Find that single one."
consider each bit separately
use x2, x1 to store number of 1's in each bit
x2 x1
0   1
1   0
1   1   =>  3 times, reset counter

```c++
// 8ms, 97%
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int x1 = 0, x2 = 0;
        for (const auto& v : nums) {
            x2 ^= x1 & v;
            x1 ^= v;
            int mask = ~(x1 & x2);
            x2 &= mask;
            x1 &= mask;
        }
        return x1;
    }
};

// 12ms, 71%
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> t(32, 0);
        for (auto n : nums) {
            int i = 0;
            while (i < 32 && n) {
                t[i] += n & 1;
                i++;
                n >>= 1;
            }
        }
        int r = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            auto v = t[i] % 3;
            if (v) {
                r += 1 << i;
            }
        }
        return r;
    }
};
