# 0142. Linked List Cycle II, medium, , freq: 24%, acceptance: 32.9%
tags:  slow/fast runner, Floyd's Tortoise and Hare
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.


Follow-up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?


assume non-circular part length A, circular part length is B.
start: slow walks length A and fast walks 2A (walks A inside circle B)
       fast is (B-A) steps behind slow
       fast needs 2(B-A) to catch up with slow
       at this time, fast just walked B-A from the entrance of the circle
       so it needs to walk A more steps to go to the entrance.

            fast = fast->next->next;

        while (p != slow) {
            p = p->next;
