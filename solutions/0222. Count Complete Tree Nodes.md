# 0222. Count Complete Tree Nodes, medium, , freq: 44%, acceptance: 35.3%

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*> qq;
        qq.push(root);
        int res = 0;
        while(!qq.empty()) {
            auto p = qq.front(); qq.pop();
            if (p) {
                res++;
                if (p->left) qq.push(p->left);
                if (p->right) qq.push(p->right);
            }
        }
        return res;
