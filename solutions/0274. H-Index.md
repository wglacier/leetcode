# 0274. H-Index, medium, , freq: 12%, acceptance: 34.8%

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

[1,7,9,4]
[4,4,0,0]
[0]
[1]
[0,1]
[3,0,6,1,5]
[0,0,0]
[10,15]

        vector<int> counts(N+1, 0);
        // get counts of each number of citation from 0 to N
        // paper1 was cited for 4 times, count of 4 citation increases by 1
        for (const auto& ct : citations) {
            counts[min(N, ct)]++;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = N; i >= 0; i--) {
            sum += counts[i];
            if (sum >= i) return i;
