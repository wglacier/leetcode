# 0287. Find the Duplicate Number, medium, , freq: 38%, acceptance: 50.4%

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

```c++
// 12ms, 73%
// consider the array to be a linked list, starting from index 0,
// each value is the index to next node
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        // first phase, find the meeting point
        int hare = 0, tort = 0;
        do {
            hare = nums[hare];
            tort = nums[nums[tort]];
        } while (hare != tort);
        
        // second phase, find the entrance to the circle
        int pt1 = hare, pt2 = 0;
        while (pt1 != pt2) {
            pt1 = nums[pt1];
            pt2 = nums[pt2];
        }
        return pt1;
    }
};
```
