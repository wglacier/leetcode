### 293. Flip Game, easy, locked
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

Example:

Input: s = "++++"
Output: 
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
Note: If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].
```c++
// 4ms, 90%
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) {
        vector<string> res;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '+' && s[i-1] == '+') {
                auto s2 = s;
                s2[i] = s2[i-1] = '-';
                res.emplace_back(s2);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
