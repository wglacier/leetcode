# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence, medium

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
Note:

There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

```c++
// 4ms, 90%
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> qq;
        for (auto& v : nums) {
            auto it = lower_bound(qq.begin(), qq.end(), v);
            if (it == qq.end()) {
                qq.push_back(v);
            } else {
                *it = v;
            }
        }
        return qq.size();
    }
};
```
