### 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown, medium
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
