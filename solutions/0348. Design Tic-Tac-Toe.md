# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe, medium, locked
Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

    vector<int> cols;

        rows.resize(n, 0);
        cols.resize(n, 0);
        d1 = d2 = 0;

        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
