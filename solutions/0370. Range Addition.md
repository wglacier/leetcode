# 370. Range Addition, medium, locked
Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

Example:

Input: length = 5, updates = [[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]]
Output: [-2,0,3,5,3]
Explanation:

Initial state:
[0,0,0,0,0]

After applying operation [1,3,2]:
[0,2,2,2,0]

After applying operation [2,4,3]:
[0,2,5,5,3]

After applying operation [0,2,-2]:
[-2,0,3,5,3]

10
[[2,4,6],[5,6,8],[1,9,-4]] => [0,-4,2,2,2,4,4,-4,-4,-4]
5
[[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]] => [-2,0,3,5,3]

            int i = pp[0], j = pp[1] + 1;
            res[i] += pp[2];
            if (j < res.size())
                res[j] -= pp[2];
        }
        partial_sum(res.begin(), res.end(), res.begin());
        return res;
    }
