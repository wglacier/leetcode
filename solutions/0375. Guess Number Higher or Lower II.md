# 0375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II, medium, , freq: 17%, acceptance: 38.2%

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

            for (int i = 1; i <= n - len + 1; i++) {
                int r = INT_MAX;
                int end = i + len - 1;
                for (int k = i; k < end; k++) {
                    int a = k + max(dp[i][k-1], dp[k+1][end]);
                    r = min(r, a);
                }
                dp[i][end] = r;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};
