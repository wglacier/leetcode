# 0397. Integer Replacement, medium, , freq: 10%, acceptance: 31.7%

Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

Example 1:

Input:
8

Output:
3

Explanation:
8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
Example 2:

Input:
7

Output:
4

Explanation:
7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or
7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

```c++
// 0ms, 100%
class Solution {
public:
    int integerReplacement(unsigned int n) {
        int res = 0;
        while (n > 1) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) n >>= 1;
            else if ((n+1) % 4 == 0 && n != 3) n += 1;
            else n -= 1;
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
