### 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height, medium
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.


Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<pair<int, int>> reconstructQueue(vector<pair<int, int>>& people) {
        // sort by height desc then by k asc
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](auto &a, auto &b) {
            return a.first > b.first || 
                (a.first == b.first && a.second < b.second);
        });
        // insert the person into their correct place.
        // because they are sorted by descending height, inserting later people don't affect people in the queue.
        vector<pair<int, int>> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++) {
            res.insert(res.begin() + people[i].second, people[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<pair<int, int>> reconstructQueue(vector<pair<int, int>>& people) {
        // sort so people with k == 0 appear first and sorted by height
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](auto &a, auto &b) {
            return a.second < b.second || 
                (a.second == b.second && a.first < b.first);
        });
        vector<pair<int, int>> res;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < people.size()) {
            auto &a = people[i];
            if (a.second == 0) {
                res.push_back(a);
            } else {
                auto it = res.begin();
                int gt = a.second;
                while (it != res.end()) {
                    if (it->first >= a.first) {
                        if (gt > 0) {
                            gt--;
                        } else {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    it++;
                }
                res.insert(it, a);
            }
            i++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
