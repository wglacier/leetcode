# 443. String Compression, easy
Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

 
Follow up:
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

 
Example 1:

Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".

        if (chars.empty()) return 0;
        
        int i = 0, j0 = 0, j = 1;
        while (j <= chars.size()) {
            while (j < chars.size() && chars[j] == chars[j0]) {
                j++;
            }
            chars[i++] = chars[j0++];
            if (j == j0) {
                j++;
                continue;
            }
            string len = to_string(j - j0 + 1);
            for (int k = 0; k < len.size(); k++) {
                chars[i+k] = len[k];
            }
            i += len.size();
            j0 = j++;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
