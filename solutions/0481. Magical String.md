A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.

The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122……"

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.

Note: N will not exceed 100,000.

Example 1:
Input: 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22

        int i = 2, j = 1;

            int no = s[i] - '0';
            s += string(no, j + '0');
            j = j == 1? 2: 1;
            i++;
        }
        auto r = s.substr(0, n);
        return count(r.begin(), r.end(), '1');
    }
};
