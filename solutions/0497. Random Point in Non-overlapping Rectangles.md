# 0497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles, medium, , freq: 2.%, acceptance: 36.1%
tags: prefix sum, binary search

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
1 <= rects.length <= 100
pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
pick is called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles rects. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[[[-2, -2, -1, -1], [1, 0, 3, 0]]], [], [], [], [], []]
["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[[[1, 1, 5, 5], [6, 7, 15, 9]]], [], [], []]

```c++
// 96ms, 53%
class Solution {
    vector<int> psums;
    vector<vector<int>> rectList;
public:
    Solution(vector<vector<int>>& rects) : rectList(rects) {
        psums.reserve(rects.size());
        int tot = 0;
        for (const auto& rt: rects) {
            tot += (rt[2] - rt[0] + 1)*(rt[3] - rt[1] + 1);
            psums.push_back(tot);
        }
        srand(time(NULL));
    }
    
    vector<int> pick() {
        int v = rand() % psums.back() + 1;
        int lo = 0, hi = psums.size()-1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int m = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
            if (v > psums[m]) lo = m + 1;
            else hi = m;
        }
        const auto& rt = rectList[lo];
        int i = v - 1 - (lo > 0? psums[lo-1] : 0);
        int width = rt[2] - rt[0] + 1;
        int x = i % width + rt[0];
        int y = i / width + rt[1];
        return {x, y};
    }
};
