# 0518. Coin Change 2, medium, , freq: 35%, acceptance: 43.5%

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
 

Note:

You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

```c++
// 0ms, 100%
class Solution {
    
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<double> dp(amount+1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (const auto coin : coins) {
            for (int m = 1; m <= amount; m++) {
                if (coin <= m) {
                    dp[m] += dp[m-coin];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
};

// TLE
class Solution {
    int count(int amount, const vector<int>& coins, int idx) {
        if (amount == 0) return 1;
        if (idx >= coins.size()) return 0;
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int t = 0; t <= amount; t += coins[idx]) {
            res += count(amount - t, coins, idx + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        return count(amount, coins, 0);
    }
};
```
