# 0526. Beautiful Arrangement, medium, , freq: 5.%, acceptance: 55.1%
tags: dp, memorization

Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 

Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
 

Note:

N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

        auto it = dp.find(key);
        if (it != dp.end())
            return it->second;
        int res = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
            int bit = 1 << (j-1);
            if ((maskUsed & bit) == 0 && opts[i][j]) {
                res += check(N, opts, maskUsed|bit, i+1, dp);
            }
        }
        dp[key] = res;

        for (int i = 1;i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
                if (i % j == 0 || j % i == 0) {
                    opts[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }

        return check(N, opts, 0, 1, dp);
    }
