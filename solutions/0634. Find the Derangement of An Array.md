# 0634. Find the Derangement of An Array, medium, locked, freq: 0p%, acceptance: 37.9%

In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].
Note:
n is in the range of [1, 106].

```c++
// 8ms, 87%
class Solution {
public:
    int findDerangement(int n) {
        if (n < 3) {
            return n == 2? 1 : 0;
        }
        const long mod = pow(10, 9) + 7;

        long a = 0, b = 1, c = 0;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            c = ((i - 1) * (a + b)) % mod;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return c;
    }
};
```
