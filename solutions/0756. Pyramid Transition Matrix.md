# 0756. Pyramid Transition Matrix, medium, , freq: 4.%, acceptance: 52.4%

We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string.

We are allowed to place any color block C on top of two adjacent blocks of colors A and B, if and only if ABC is an allowed triple.

We start with a bottom row of bottom, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples allowed. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3.

Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.

Example 1:

Input: bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG", "CDE", "GEA", "FFF"]
Output: true
Explanation:
We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  G   E
 / \ / \
B   C   D

We are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.
 

Example 2:

Input: bottom = "AABA", allowed = ["AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAC"]
Output: false
Explanation:
We can't stack the pyramid to the top.
Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.
 

Note:

bottom will be a string with length in range [2, 8].
allowed will have length in range [0, 200].
Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}.

```c++
// 4ms, 95%
class Solution {
    bool check(const string& bottom, int i, string next, const vector<vector<int>>& allowedChars) {
        if (bottom.size() == 1)
            return true;
        if (i >= bottom.size() - 1) {
            return check(next, 0, "", allowedChars);
        }
        int mask = allowedChars[bottom[i]-'A'][bottom[i+1] - 'A'];
        if (mask != 0) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << j)) > 0) {
                    if (check(bottom, i+1, next + (char)('A' + j), allowedChars))
                        return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
public:
    bool pyramidTransition(string bottom, vector<string>& allowed) {
        vector<vector<int>> allowedChars(7, vector<int>(7, 0));
        for (const auto& s : allowed) {
            allowedChars[s[0] - 'A'][s[1] - 'A'] |= 1 << (s[2] - 'A');
        }
        return check(bottom, 0, "", allowedChars);
    }
};
