# 0797. All Paths From Source to Target, medium, , freq: 33%, acceptance: 71.0%

Given a directed, acyclic graph of N nodes.  Find all possible paths from node 0 to node N-1, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.  graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.

Example:
Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
Explanation: The graph looks like this:
0--->1
|    |
v    v
2--->3
There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
Note:

The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range [2, 15].
You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.

```c++
// 72ms, 92%
class Solution {
    void dfs(const vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& buf, int i, vector<vector<int>>& res) {
        if (i == graph.size() - 1) {
            res.push_back(buf);
            return;
        }
        for (const auto& v : graph[i]) {
            buf.push_back(v);
            dfs(graph, buf, v, res);
            buf.pop_back();
        }
    }
public:
    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        vector<int> buf;
        buf.push_back(0);
        dfs(graph, buf, 0, res);
        return res;
    }
};
```
