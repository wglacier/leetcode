# 0801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing, medium, , freq: 7.%, acceptance: 35.3%

We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
Note:

A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].
A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].

        int keep1 = 0, swap1 = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); i++) {
            int keep2 = INT_MAX, swap2 = INT_MAX;
            if (A[i-1] < A[i] && B[i-1] < B[i]) {
                keep2 = keep1;
                swap2 = swap1 + 1;
            }
            if (A[i-1] < B[i] && B[i-1] < A[i]) {
                keep2 = min(keep2, swap1);
                swap2 = min(swap2, keep1 + 1);
            }
            keep1 = keep2;
            swap1 = swap2;
        }
        return min(keep1, swap1);
    }
};
