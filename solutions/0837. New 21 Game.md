# 0837. New 21 Game, medium, , freq: 24%, acceptance: 32.0%
tags: dynamic programming

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?

Example 1:

Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
Example 2:

Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
Example 3:

Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
Output: 0.73278
Note:

0 <= K <= N <= 10000
1 <= W <= 10000

# notes:
* when Alice finishes, the points must be in range [K, K+W-1]

```c++
// 0ms, 100%
class Solution {
public:
    double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
        // dp[k] is the probability of getting k points
        // assuming this time gets 1, 2 .. W points,
        // so dp[k] = (dp[k-1] + dp[k-2] + dp[k-W]) * (1/W)
        if (K < 1) return 1;
        //if (K + W < N) return 1;
        
        vector<double> dp(max(K+W, N+1), 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        double prev = 1;    // sliding window of W
        double res = 0;
        for (int k = 1; k <= N; k++) {
            dp[k] = prev * (1.0/W);
            // results = dp[K] + dp[K+1] + ... + dp[N]
            if (k >= K) {
                res += dp[k];
            }
            // if sliding window >= K, no need to add dp[k]
            // as Alice has to stop after getting points >= K
            if (k < K) {
                prev += dp[k];
            }
            if (k-W >= 0) {
                prev -= dp[k-W];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
