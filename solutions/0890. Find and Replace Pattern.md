# 0890. Find and Replace Pattern, medium, , freq: 3.%, acceptance: 71.4%

You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.
 

Note:

1 <= words.length <= 50
1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20

        vector<int> buf('z'+1, 0);
        int no = 1;
        for (const auto& c : s) {
            res.push_back(buf[c] > 0? buf[c] : buf[c] = no++);
            
        }
        return res;
    }
public:
    vector<string> findAndReplacePattern(vector<string>& words, string pattern) {
        auto p = encode(pattern);
        vector<string> res;
        for (const auto& w : words) {
            if (encode(w) == p) {
                res.push_back(w);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
