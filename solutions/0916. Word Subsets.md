# 0916. Word Subsets, medium, , freq: 0p%, acceptance: 45.5%

We are given two arrays A and B of words.  Each word is a string of lowercase letters.

Now, say that word b is a subset of word a if every letter in b occurs in a, including multiplicity.  For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior", but is not a subset of "world".

Now say a word a from A is universal if for every b in B, b is a subset of a. 

Return a list of all universal words in A.  You can return the words in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
Example 2:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
Example 3:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","oo"]
Output: ["facebook","google"]
Example 4:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["lo","eo"]
Output: ["google","leetcode"]
Example 5:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["ec","oc","ceo"]
Output: ["facebook","leetcode"]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length, B.length <= 10000
1 <= A[i].length, B[i].length <= 10
A[i] and B[i] consist only of lowercase letters.
All words in A[i] are unique: there isn't i != j with A[i] == A[j].
