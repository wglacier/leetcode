# 0948. Bag of Tokens, medium, , freq: 0p%, acceptance: 39.5%
tags: greedy

You have an initial power P, an initial score of 0 points, and a bag of tokens.

Each token can be used at most once, has a value token[i], and has potentially two ways to use it.

If we have at least token[i] power, we may play the token face up, losing token[i] power, and gaining 1 point.
If we have at least 1 point, we may play the token face down, gaining token[i] power, and losing 1 point.
Return the largest number of points we can have after playing any number of tokens.

 

Example 1:

Input: tokens = [100], P = 50
Output: 0
Example 2:

Input: tokens = [100,200], P = 150
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], P = 200
Output: 2
 

Note:

tokens.length <= 1000
0 <= tokens[i] < 10000
0 <= P < 10000

class Solution {
public:
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& tokens, int P) {
        sort(tokens.begin(), tokens.end());
        int points = 0;
        int res = 0;
        int lo = 0, hi = tokens.size() - 1;
        while (lo <= hi && (points > 0 || P > 0)) {
            if (P > 0 && P >= tokens[lo]) {
                P -= tokens[lo];
                lo++;
                points++;
                res = max(points, res);
            } else if (points > 0) {
                points--;
                P += tokens[hi];
                hi--;
            } else break;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
