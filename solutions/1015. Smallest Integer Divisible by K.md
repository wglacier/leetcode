# 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K, medium, , freq: 0p%, acceptance: 29.1%
tags: math

Given a positive integer K, you need find the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N.  If there is no such N, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
 

Note:

1 <= K <= 10^5

```c++
// 0ms, 100%
/*
    If N exists, as it ends with '1', it is not divisible by 2 and 5
    So if K is divisible by 2 or 5 just return -1

    Controdiction for N exists between 1, 11, 111, ..., (K 1's):
      From array A of numbers 1, 11, 111 to 111... (K 1's), there are K numbers.
      Suppose N doesn't exist, so there is no number in A is divisible by K.
      Which means the remainders of A[i] % K are unique.
      But there are only K-1 numbers from 1 to K-1 and there are K numbers in A.
      So at least two remainders are the same. Suppose they A[i] % K == A[j] % K.
      (A[i] - A[j]) % K = 0. (A[i] - A[j]) Must end with '0' (something like 111111 - 111)
      As K is not divisible by 5, (A[i] - A[j]) % K = 0 can't be true.

            return -1;
         for (int r = 1, i = 1; i <= K; i++) {
             if (r % K == 0) return i;
             r = (r * 10 + 1) % K;
         }
         return -1;
    }
