# 1025. Divisor Game, easy, , freq: 10%, acceptance: 64.2%

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000

```c++
// 0ms, 100%
class Solution {
private:
    bool check(int N, vector<int>& dp) {
        if (dp[N] >= 0)
            return dp[N];
        for (int n = 1; n*n < N; n++) {
            if (N % n == 0) {
                if (!(check(N-n, dp))) {
                    dp[N] = true;
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        dp[N] = false;
        return false;
    }
public:
    bool divisorGame(int N) {
        vector<int> dp(1001, -1);
        return check(N, dp);
    }
};

```
