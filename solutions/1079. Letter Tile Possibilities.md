# 1079. Letter Tile Possibilities, medium, , freq: 1.%, acceptance: 75.9%

You have a set of tiles, where each tile has one letter tiles[i] printed on it.  Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make.

 

Example 1:

Input: "AAB"
Output: 8
Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".
Example 2:

Input: "AAABBC"
Output: 188
 

Note:

1 <= tiles.length <= 7
tiles consists of uppercase English letters.

    1. count the number of each unique char
    2. recursively call count(), each level calculates a different length of possible sequence
    In the first level, take one from each unique char, represents a size 1 sequence
    In the next level, take one from each unique char, combining with previous char forms a size 2 sequences
