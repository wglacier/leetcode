# 1120. Maximum Average Subtree, medium, locked, freq: 0p%, acceptance: 60.1%
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

Example 1:

Input: [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation: 
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 5000.
Each node will have a value between 0 and 100000.
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.
