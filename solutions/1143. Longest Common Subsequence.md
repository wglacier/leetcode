# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence, medium, , freq: 0p%, acceptance: 54.2%

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= text1.length <= 1000
1 <= text2.length <= 1000
The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        const int M = text1.size();
        const int N = text2.size();
        if (M == 0 || N == 0) return 0;
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(M+1, vector<int>(N+1, 0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
                if (text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[M][N];
    }
};
