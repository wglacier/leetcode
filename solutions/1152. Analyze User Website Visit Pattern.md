# 1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern, medium, locked

You are given three arrays username, timestamp and website of the same length N where the ith tuple means that the user with name username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].

A 3-sequence is a list of not necessarily different websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.

Find the 3-sequence visited at least once by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically minimum solution.

A 3-sequence X is lexicographically smaller than a 3-sequence Y if X[0] < Y[0] or X[0] == Y[0] and (X[1] < Y[1] or X[1] == Y[1] and X[2] < Y[2]). 

It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least 3 websites. No user visits two websites at the same time.

Example 1:

Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
Output: ["home","about","career"]
Explanation: 
The tuples in this example are:
["joe", 1, "home"]
["joe", 2, "about"]
["joe", 3, "career"]
["james", 4, "home"]
["james", 5, "cart"]
["james", 6, "maps"]
["james", 7, "home"]
["mary", 8, "home"]
["mary", 9, "about"]
["mary", 10, "career"]
The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 

Note:

3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50
1 <= username[i].length <= 10
0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9
1 <= website[i].length <= 10
Both username[i] and website[i] contain only lowercase characters.
