# 1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks, medium

You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Example 2:

Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
 

Constraints:

1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4
1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4

            int b = qq.top(); qq.pop();
