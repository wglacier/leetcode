# 1197. Minimum Knight Moves, medium
In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.



Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y].  It is guaranteed the answer exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
Example 2:

Input: x = 5, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
 

Constraints:

|x| + |y| <= 300

note:
    it's symmetric for the 4 quadrants, so just need to consider one quadrant
```c++
// 8ms, 87%
class Solution {
    int check(int x, int y, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        if (x + y == 0) return 0;
        if (x + y == 2) return 2;
        if (dp[x][y] >= 0) return dp[x][y];
        int r = min(check(abs(x-1), abs(y-2), dp), check(abs(x-2), abs(y-1), dp)) + 1;
        dp[x][y] = r;
        return r;
    }
public:
    int minKnightMoves(int x, int y) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(301, vector<int>(301, -1));
        return check(abs(x), abs(y), dp);
    }
};
```
